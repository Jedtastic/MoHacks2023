    <h1> Priority Number </h1>
    <p>Everyone once registered will have a pager synced to their personal health file and instructions on where they are to go through the pager
        Prioritization is determined via a point system done by the examiner and the points it goes off of are based on how urgent they need to be seen (how bad the injury is).
        Time of wait is considered when it comes to non-urgent injuries especially for broken bones and flu. For things that a family doctor can do, patients are directed towards a family doctor clinic rather than using the ER.
        Major injuries are 4 points
        If you are blind, deaf, in need of assistance, or have a language barrier with regular injuries, it is 3 points
        For regular injuries like a broken bone, it is 2 points
        If it is an injury that can be taken care of by a family doctor, it is 1 point
        All 1 points are sent to the family doctors' clinic
        Each half hour waiting is 0.1 points added onto their original point count 
        The higher the point count, the higher the patient is in the queue to ensure patients are not waiting too long
