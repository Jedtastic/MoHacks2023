    <h1>Press For Assistance</h1>
    <p>This is when at any time, if someone needs assistance urgently or new injuries are sustained, they just press the call for assistance button and hit the prompt Yes 
        When asked to confirm you need help, a volunteer will be sent to that location given the IPS data, and upon arrival the volunteer will try and help however they can within reason 
        Volunteers and translators are available at the registration desk upon both request and necessity
