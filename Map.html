    <h1>Map</h1>
    <p>The IPS takes care of all confusion on where patients need to be in a hospital
        When being sent to a new location within the hospital there will be directions you can take that will get you there and upon arrival you will be immediately sent a notification saying you have arrived at the new location
        Estimated wait time will be changed and priority number will be updated based on your new location
        When the IPS exits the hospital, the IPS' internal beeper will go off alerting security at that doorway to ensure it doesnâ€™t get stolen
